# nekobo Project

**Nekobo** is an open-source robotics project that combines **hardware (FreeCAD, KiCad)** and **software (ROS2 + Python)** to create a small, cute, and hackable robot.  
The goal is to make a platform that is **easy to build, easy to program, and fun to extend**.

## ✨ Features (v0.1)
- Hardware:
  - First FreeCAD model (`.fcstd`) + STL export for 3D printing
  - Early draft of KiCad schematic
  - Basic Bill of Materials (BOM)
- Software:
  - Minimal ROS2 package (`nekobo_pkg`)
  - Hello-world ROS2 node to test setup
- Container:
  - Dockerfile for reproducible dev environment (ROS2 + Python3)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nekobo.git
cd nekobo
```

### 2. Build container
```bash
docker build -t nekobo-dev ./container
```

### 3. Run hello-world ROS2 node
```bash
docker run -it --rm nekobo-dev
source /ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 run nekobo_pkg hello_node
```

You should see:
```bash
[INFO] [hello_node]: Hello Nekobo!
```
